== Commits

Our convention is to write each commit message in the imperative tense.

There are no constraints on the rest of the message, and do use it to communicate to other developers the intent behind your commit.

Split your commits up to individual commits if you can.

TIP: Emacs users should make use of Magit's hunk staging capabilities
